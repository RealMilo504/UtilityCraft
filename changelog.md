## BLOCKS
### General
- Added Crushed Blackstone
- Added four levels of Compressed Crushed Blackstone
- Area-based blocks, such as Pedestal with Clock, now show an outline briefly after being placed, indicating the area that will be affected by the block.
  - Using a Wrench, it is possible to show the outline again, for an undefined amount of time.
  - Harvester, Block Breaker and Block Placer are also affected by that.
- Bountiful Crops
  - Crops now support Fortune enchantment.
- Reworked Bonsais:
  - Improved performance by optimizing its model and scripts.
  - Growth time now scales properly based on the used soil.
  - No longer ejects its loot if the container below it is full.

### Generators
- Wind Turbine
  - Basic, Advanced, Expert
    - Decreased maximum altitude multiplier from 3x (300%) to 2x (200%).
  - Ultimate
    - Decreased maximum altitude multiplier from 4x (400%) to 2.5x (250%).

### Machines
- Completely redesigned every machine and generator interface.
  - Added dedicated tabs for:
    - **Information**: A small panel containing useful info about the machine
    - **I/O Configuration**: A dedicated panel for controlling the input and output of items and fluids, replacing the function of the Smart Filter.
    - **Upgrades**: A dedicated panel for upgrade slots.
    - **Recipes**: A new panel including recipes, drops and other possible uses for a machine.
- Machines are now compatible with custom upgrades, such as [Ascendant Technology](https://github.com/DoriosStudios/Ascendant-Technology)'s Hyper Processing Upgrade.
- Machines can now be fully upgraded by interacting with them.
  - While holding a supported upgrade, the player can interact with the machine to apply one upgrade. Interacting while sneaking will apply all upgrades of the same type.
- Autosieve
  - Changed most of its drops and progression line, including resources that weren't used anywhere in the addon.
- Mechanical Hopper
  - Improved its settings form and quick-settings flow.
- Way Center
  - Reworked its funcionality and interface.
    - Balanced teleport cost and added max distance limits.
    - Improved destination handling with a more precise and safer teleportation system.
- XP Condenser
  - Completely Reworked its interface and funcionality.
    - No longer work with forms. Instead, it has a dedicated UI just like any other machine.
    - No longer resets your XP.
    - Now uses a fixed 256.0B tank instead of having four tank slots.

### Transportation
- Added Creative Blocks
  - Creative blocks are used to provide infinite resources for testing and creative purposes.
  - There are three types of creative blocks: **Creative Battery**, **Creative Liquid Tank** and **Creative Gas Tank**.
- Added Gas Pipes
  - Gas pipes are used to transport and extract gases from their containers, such as Gas Tanks.
  - There are five colored gas pipes: **Purple** *(Default)*, **Blue**, **Yellow**, **Red** and **Green**.
    - Just like items and liquids, different colored pipes cannot interfere with each other.
- Added Gas Tanks
  - Gas tanks are used to store gases, such as Steam, used by Heavy Machinery extension to store and control gas flow.
  - There are four levels: Basic, Advanced, Expert and Ultimate.
  - Their capacity are the same as their liquid counterparts, but they are not interchangeable.
- Improved Exporter, Importer and Liquid Extractor interfaces.
- Improved transfer caching and endpoint handling.
- Reworked Item Conduits and Fluid Pipes around the new machine I/O system.
  - Exporters and importers respect configured machine faces, preventing items from entering faces that are not input faces.
  - Added native Item Ducts Redux compatibility through DoriosCore.
  - Pipes can now be configured using a Wrench.

## FLUIDS
- Renamed Fluid terminology to Liquid.

## ITEMS
### General
- Added the **Copy/Paste Tool**.
  - Copies and pastes compatible settings from Item Exporters, Liquid and Gas Extractors, Mechanical Hoppers, Droppers, Uppers, machines, generators, and pipes.
  - Sneak + Interact opens a localized menu to choose which Item, Liquid, Gas, filter, and direction settings are copied, switch between Copy and Paste modes, or clear the saved configuration.
  - When direction copying is disabled, machine I/O is rotated relative to the target block so each configured face is preserved correctly.
  - Pasting copied filters requires the target block to have a Filter Upgrade; otherwise, the operation is canceled with a **Missing Filter Upgrade** message.
- Removed unused/paused items and blocks from creative menu.
- Reworked how Accelerator Clocks works:
  - There are now three types of Accelerator Clocks: **Gold**, **Diamond** and **Nether Star**.
  - Gold Accelerator Clock:
    - Replaced the old Accelerator Clock
    - Has a 18% chance to jump forward a crop growth stage.
